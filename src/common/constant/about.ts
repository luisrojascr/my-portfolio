   Hi, I’m Luis Rojas—a Costa Rican full-stack engineer with 10 + years of turning ambitious product ideas into fast, elegant, and scalable web experiences. I cut my teeth transforming PSDs into pixel-perfect sites and now lead React/Next.js, TypeScript, and Node projects that serve hundreds of thousands of users. Along the way I’ve:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Modernized legacy platforms</strong>—migrating large React class-component codebases to Next.js + GraphQL for ISSA, slashing load times and unlocking new features.</li>
    <li><strong>Elevated user workflows</strong>—redesigned HR and dispatch tools that boosted efficiency by 20 % at Associa and improved recruiting speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Built AI-powered products</strong>—from an interior-design app that analyzes room photos with OpenAI & Vision APIs to data-driven dashboards for e-commerce leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I thrive in agile teams where clean code, thoughtful UX, and clear communication drive the roadmap. Whether architecting REST/GraphQL APIs in Node.js or polishing the last pixel in React, my goal is the same: ship delightful software that scales.
</p>
<p>
    In my career, I've worked for a wide range of companies, from large corporations to innovative startups.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s collaborate and build something remarkable together.
